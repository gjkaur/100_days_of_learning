Creating a comprehensive roadmap for learning Pandas involves breaking down the library's functionalities into key topics. Here's a roadmap that covers the essential aspects of Pandas:

### 1. **Introduction to Pandas**
   - Overview of Pandas and its importance in data analysis.
   - Installation of Pandas.

### 2. **Data Structures in Pandas**
   - Series: Introduction and manipulation.
   - DataFrame: Creating, indexing, and basic operations.

### 3. **Data Input/Output**
   - Reading and writing data in different formats:
     - CSV
     - Excel
     - SQL databases
     - JSON
     - HTML
     - Pickle

### 4. **Data Exploration and Manipulation**
   - Descriptive statistics: `describe()`, `info()`, etc.
   - Handling missing data: `dropna()`, `fillna()`.
   - Filtering and selecting data.
   - Sorting and ranking data.

### 5. **Indexing and Selecting Data**
   - Indexing with `iloc` and `loc`.
   - Conditional selection.
   - Setting and resetting index.

### 6. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removing duplicates: `duplicated()`, `drop_duplicates()`.
   - Renaming columns and indexing.

### 7. **Data Transformation**
   - Applying functions to data: `apply()`, `map()`.
   - Grouping and aggregation: `groupby()`, `agg()`.
   - Merging and joining DataFrames.

### 8. **Time Series Data**
   - Working with date and time data.
   - Resampling and frequency conversion.
